Project Requirements
These are the main guidelines, you are free to add more than is required here (coloured output,
terminal animations, etc.) to personalize your project and make it your own.
1. Your program must have a command line prompt that is used for all interactions with the
Jeopardy system.
2. The program must ask for the names of the four players who will be playing Jeopardy, each
player must enter their name and have it recorded in the system and their initial earnings set as
0.
3. The program then starts the game of Jeopardy and prints out each of the question categories
and displays the dollar values for each question.
4. The program must accept the name of the person selected to pick the category and question.
○ You can select the person any way you choose (first person to raise their hand, random
selection, etc.).
○ The program must validate that the name of the person entered is correct and matches to
one of the players.
5. Once the player’s name has been entered the program must prompt the player for the
category and dollar amount question.
○ The program must verify that the category and dollar amount question has not already
been answered.
6. The program must then display the question for the player to then answer.
○ The questions and answers can be defined for each category and for each dollar amount
for each category.
○ However, if you want to make the game more interesting for multiple playthroughs you
can have a bank of question and randomly select each question for each category from
this question bank.
7. After the question is displayed, the program must prompt the player for the answer, the
player must enter the answer starting with one of the following: what is or who is.
○ You will need to use string tokenization to parse the answer, use the resources above to
help.
○ To make the game easier to program you can have every question only required a one
word answer.
8. After the player answers the question the program must display whether they got it correct
or incorrect.
○ If the player answered the question correctly the program must update their score.
○ If they answered incorrectly the program will display the answer and no user will receive
any points.
○ The question must then be marked as answered so it cannot be used again.
9. After the question has been completed, the program must print the remaining categories and
question dollar amounts, then repeat requirements 4 to 9, until all of the questions have been
completed.
10. Once the players have completed all of the questions the game must then print each of the
players from the first place to last place and print their total earnings.
○ The player with the highest earnings is the winner.
